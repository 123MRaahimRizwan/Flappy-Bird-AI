# Flappy Bird AI

1. This Project is the famous game called Flappy Bird but the change is that an AI plays it rather than humans.

2. This game uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Algorithm which works on the fundamentals of Neural Networks.

3. You can simply clone the repository and run the `main.py` file in order to witness the game being played.
